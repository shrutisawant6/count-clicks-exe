# To track number of mouse clicks ðŸ–±

We live in an era where attention to detail is valued, and there is a heightened focus on health.
From tracking pulse rate to steps taken, monitoring protein intake and calories burned, so why not consider tracking the number of mouse clicks?

Here is a simple executable that can provide your click count until prompted.

The factors that could influence the count are:
- Mouse condition
- Laptop touchpad sensitivity
- Pressure applied while clicking
- Duration between clicks
